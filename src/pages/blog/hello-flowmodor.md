## Start of the Journey

As a student and also a developer, I have constantly searched for the best productivity method over the past few years.

I've tried out the Pomodoro Technique. It's effective when I really lack motivation. However, in normal situations, I prefer to focus for longer periods to enter a flow state, which isn't feasible with the Pomodoro's 25-minute work duration.

After some research, I discovered the Flowtime Technique (a.k.a Flowmodoro). I tried it out, and it works really well. The only drawback is that the setup is somewhat cumbersome. Every time I start working, I have to run a stopwatch. And when I decide to take a break, I need to stop it, divide the time by 5, and then set a countdown timer.

I thought this process could be automated. So, I tried some existing flowmodoro websites, but none completely met my needs.

Thus, I decided to build my own.

## The Plan

The main 3 features of Flowmodor will be:
- ðŸ•’ **Flowmodoro Timer:** Counts up during focus sessions and counts down during breaks, based on your focus duration.
- ðŸ“‹ **Task List:** Helps organize and manage tasks, integrating them with focus sessions.
- ðŸ“Š **Focus Report:** Tracks and summarizes focus and break patterns to enhance productivity insights.

The first feature is pretty much complete, and I'm currently using it. The other two are under development.

## Release Date?

The good news is that you don't have to wait until the official release day of Flowmodor. Instead, you can become a beta tester by joining the [waitlist](/#getWaitlistContainer)!

Once the first two features are finished, I'll grant access to beta testers. You can then provide feedback for improvements. Join me on this journey!

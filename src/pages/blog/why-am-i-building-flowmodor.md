## What is Flowmodor

Flowmodor is an open-source flowmodoro timer web app based on the Flowtime Technique, an alternative to the Pomodoro Technique.

## Why am I building this

As a developer, I find the Flowtime Technique very effective. It solves my problem with Pomodoro Technique. However, the current tools available online are not very user-friendly. Therefore, I've decided to build one myself.

## How can I access Flowmodor

Flowmodor is currently undergoing development. I'm actively working on enhancing its features and greatly value your feedback. To gain early access, you're invited to join [waitlist](/#getWaitlistContainer).
